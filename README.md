An esaier way to upload from DCT(data collection terminal) to 1c</br>
Usuall algorithm is:
* Finding an app in which you have to load all goods data which could be too much.
* Creating a document in this app.
* Scanning goods.
* After scanning is done all data has to be saved in special format which 1c could understand.
* Open this data and save it into a document.


Using this app can help avoid complicated steps and there'll be only 2 steps:
* Choose document in which context you'll work.
* Scan </br>

So you can use DCT just as a barcode scanner with instant confirmation if data is succefully added to 1c.
